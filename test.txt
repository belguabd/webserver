Your second output (1.06738 kB) is correct and expected! Hereâ€™s why:

Understanding the File Size
Your file (index.html) is 1.1K, which usually means between 1100 and 1126 bytes, depending on how the OS rounds it.

Why Does It Show 1.06738 kB Instead of 1.1 kB?
Exact Byte Count Matters

The OS might round 1.1K to 1,126 bytes or 1,100 bytes for display.
Your calculation (file_offset / 1024.0) is precise:
If the file is 1092 bytes, it would show:
cpp
Copy
Edit
1092 / 1024.0 = 1.06738 kB
If the file were 1126 bytes, it would be:
cpp
Copy
Edit
1126 / 1024.0 = 1.09961 kB
Rounding Differences

The system (ls -lh) rounds up to 1.1K, but your program calculates the exact floating-point value.
